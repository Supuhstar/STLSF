<h3>Saturday, September 1, 2018 9:00am-5:30pm</h3>
           <h3>St. Louis Science Center @ 5050 Oakland, St. Louis, MO 63110</h3>
<h3>Registration begins at 8:30</h3>
           <h4>Optional dinner at 6:00pm</h4>

<p>Ticket includes: coffee and donuts, presentations, salad and sandwich buffet, Destination Moon exhibit, parking, afternoon snack, and one year’s membership to St. Louis Space Frontier. <a href="https://gatewaytospace2018.eventbrite.com">Register on Eventbrite</a> </p>


<p>Gateway to Space 2018 focuses on an important space settlement destination: The Moon. This one day conference about living and working on the Moon includes a tour of the Destination Moon exhibit at the St. Louis Science Center. </p>


<p>Kick-off the morning with coffee, donuts, and registration at 8:30am, followed by a warm welcome from St. Louis Space Frontier president Christine Nobbe.</p>

<p>Keynote Speaker Dr. Peter Schubert, a renowned researcher, author, and inventor from IUPUI, will present on two topics described in detail below.
Local experts, Dave Dietzler and Bryce Meyer, will share information on in situ resource mining and space farming.
</p>

<p>Dr. Brad Jolliff of Washington University in St. Louis will present a scientist's perspective on why we should Return to the Moon.
</p>
<p>During lunch, a salad and sandwich buffet, we will honor our Gateway to Space awardees, Brian Stofiel of Stofiel Aerospace and the Saint Louis Science Center team.
</p>
            <p>
Exploring the Destination Moon exhibit, with the Apollo 11 command module and other artifacts, reminds us of our dream to settle the Moon and leads us to advocate for a Moon Village, a concept to be discussed at Gateway to Space.</p>

<p>An optional, pay your own way, dinner is being planned for 6pm at a favorite St. Louis restaurant. (more information to follow)</p>

            <h3>Dr. Peter J. Schubert</h3>
<p>Dr. Peter J. Schubert is Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and serves there as the Director of the Richard G. Lugar Center for Renewable Energy. His doctorate is from Purdue, his master's degree is from Cincinnati, and he holds a Bachelor of Arts in Physics from Washington University, where he was a member of the Thurtene Leadership Honorary. He has 42 patents in the US plus 13 more in the EU, and has published over 100 technical papers in 11 distinct fields of study. Schubert has been Principal Investigator on research grants from DoD, DOE, USDA, NSF, and GSA, plus two SBIRs from NASA, and ran an experiment on the Vomit Comet including 27 lunar gravity parabolas. Peter's primary interest is Space Solar Power derived from lunar and asteroidal materials.
</p>

<p>Dr. Schubert's first talk: Pathway to Power via the Moon
This is a TED talk format for a compelling vision whereby a lunar village, which is self-sufficient when including C-class asteroidal materials, can be used to fabricate the components of a GEO-located solar power satellite. The enterprise will be cash positive. But more important, the pathway between 2018 and this vision is laid down so that each step is cash-positive. A key is the use of cryptocurrency and smart contracts with a new token to be introduced publicly for the first time at GtS 2018.</p>

<p>Dr. Schubert's second talk:  Corruption Resistant Governance for Space
Humans are often selfish, greedy, and inconsiderate and to govern themselves requires a means by which corruption is thwarted. Stochastic Democracy is one candidate for home rule of space habitats which meets these criteria. Results from three previously published AIAA papers will be summarized, followed by a preview of a fourth paper to be published at SPACE 2018 a few weeks later.</p>


<h3>Dr. Brad Jolliff</h3>
<p>Dr. Brad Jolliff is the Scott Rudolph Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. His research focus is on the Moon and Mars, the materials that make up their surfaces, and what they tell about the planet’s history. Jolliff is a member of the Mars Exploration Rovers team and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera science team. He has served on the Science Committee of the NASA Advisory Council, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey for Solar System Exploration, and on the committee that advises NASA on the curation and allocation of extraterrestrial materials.
</p>

<p>Dr. Jolliff’s talk: Science Priorities for a Return to the Moon
Where should we go and what should we do when we return to the Moon? What are we doing now to prepare for the next generation of activity on the Moon?  Dr. Jolliff provides a scientists' perspective on these questions.</p>


<h3>Bryce L. Meyer</h3>
<p>Bryce L. Meyer has a varied background in engineering and technologies with experiences in fields and on waters. He has graduate degrees in engineering and biology, works for universities, runs technology companies, and does independent research into space farms and bioreactors. He has written and illustrated children's STEM books on space and marine life, and has dozens of published papers and talks. His motto: "Why space? TRILLIONS of happy, smiling babies!"
</p>


<p>Mr. Meyer's talk: Space Farming, Menus, and Biological Life Support: For Here and There
In space, whether in zero gravity like the ISS, or in gravity, as in rotating stations or on the Moon or Mars, room is tight and mass is expensive! What technologies will make growing food in space possible? How do we tie various machines and organisms together to feed people and recycle air and water? How do we make farms that can provide food to other settlements and maybe even back to Earth? What kinds of meals can future space tourists, workers, or settlers expect?</p>

            <h3>David Dietzler</h3>

<p>David Dietzler is a lifelong space enthusiast ever since he was a tiny tot watching Mercury rockets lift off on TV. Later on came Gemini, Apollo, Lost in Space, Star Trek, and much, much more. When he got a library card he became a voracious reader of books by Von Braun, Wily Ley, A.C. Clarke, and others. Today he searches the internet reading all about space and science connected with space exploration which includes astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, life sciences, and math. Mr. Dietzler has written over 60 articles for the Moon Miners Manifesto and has had several articles published in Ad Astra and Spaceflight, a publication of the British Interplanetary Society. He has a website at: https://moonminer.info/ </p>

<p>Mr Dietzler's talk: Mining the Moon: Lunar Resources
The resources of the Moon include free vacuum, solar energy, low gravity, polar crater ices, and regolith (lunar soil).  The regolith contains oxygen; metals; traces of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen; and other elements needed for construction and living on the Moon. Ways of mining, methods of element extraction, and manufacturing useful items with lunar resources are to be discussed.</p>

<h4>The Destination Moon exhibit is delightful and will be most memorable sharing the experience with people who love space exploration.
